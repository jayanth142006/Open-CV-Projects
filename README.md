#  Computer Vision Pose & Gesture Recognition Suite
This project integrates multiple real-time computer vision applications using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and LSTM-based models:

ðŸ”¹ Gym Pose Detection & Rep Counter
Detects and classifies push-ups and squats using pose landmarks from MediaPipe.

Counts reps in real-time with high accuracy.

Trained an LSTM model on 30 sequences of 30 frames for each exercise class.

ðŸ”¹ Sign Language Recognition
Recognizes basic gestures: "Hello", "Thank You", and "I Love You".

Uses MediaPipe hand and pose landmarks + LSTM for gesture classification.

ðŸ”¹ Air Canvas Tools
Air Canvas Painting: Draw in the air with finger tracking.

Air Math Calculator: Write digits and operators in the air to solve expressions.

Air Snap Filters: Select from virtual masks that align with and track your face in real-time.

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack:

Python

MediaPipe

OpenCV

NumPy

TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
